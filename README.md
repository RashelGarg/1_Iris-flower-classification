# Iris-flower-classification
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on specific measurements. Iris flowers are classified into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, each of which exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of measurements.
